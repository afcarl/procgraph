The ProcGraph tutorial
======================

Welcome to the ProcGraph tutorial. 

This tutorial will guide you through the first steps with ProcGraph, from the 
basic syntax, up to the recommended design patterns and how to document your 
creations.


Before you start: Albeit ProcGraph is pretty much data-agnostic, most of the examples involve
reading and manipulating a video, as it is fun to have an immediate visual
feedback of what you are doing. All the scripts refer to a file ``coastguard.mp4``,
included in the sources, which should be in your directory.

Even though it is fine to read this on the web, cutting&paste the examples to your terminal,
it is advised that you download the ProcGraph source code. There, in the directory
``docs/tutorial`` you will find all these scripts and resources in separate files ready to run.
