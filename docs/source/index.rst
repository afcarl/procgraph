ProcGraph
=========

|procgraph| ("processing graph") is a Python library for rapid prototyping of processing pipelines for logged and realtime data.  New blocks can be added in Python, or using a textual model specification language.


**Note: this is currently very unstable software (albeit I use it day to day). Adventurous early adopters are welcome!**
